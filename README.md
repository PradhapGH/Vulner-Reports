01.Broken Authentication

Description: Flaws in authentication mechanisms that allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.
Impact: Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information.
Mitigation: Implement multi-factor authentication, secure password policies, and session management.

02.Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Vulnerability

Description: Misconfiguration of CORS policies allowing unauthorized domains to access restricted resources.
Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive data and user information.
Mitigation: Correctly configure CORS policies to only allow trusted domains.

03.Denial-of-Service (CVE-2007-6750)

Description: An attack that aims to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with a flood of requests.
Impact: Service downtime, loss of availability, and potential financial loss.
Mitigation: Implement rate limiting, firewalls, and robust input validation.

04.DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

Description: XSS attacks that occur when the client-side script in the page modifies the DOM in an unsafe way.
Impact: Execution of malicious scripts, session hijacking, and data theft.
Mitigation: Properly sanitize and validate all inputs and outputs within the DOM.

05.DOM-Based Open Redirection

Description: Redirecting users to untrusted websites via unsafe modifications to the DOM.
Impact: Phishing, malware distribution, and loss of user trust.
Mitigation: Validate and restrict URLs used for redirection.

06.External Service Interaction Vulnerability

Description: Flaws that allow unauthorized interaction with external systems or services.
Impact: Data leakage, unauthorized access to external services, and potential service disruption.
Mitigation: Validate and sanitize inputs, and restrict external interactions.

07.Security Misconfiguration

Description: Insecure settings or configurations left by default or improperly configured.
Impact: Unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.
Mitigation: Regularly review and update configurations, and disable default accounts.

08.Source Code Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2010-2333)

Description: Exposure of source code through improper server configurations or vulnerabilities.
Impact: Exposure of sensitive data and intellectual property, facilitating other attacks.
Mitigation: Properly configure servers, and use code obfuscation techniques.

09.SQL Injection Vulnerability

Description: Exploiting insufficient input validation to manipulate SQL queries.
Impact: Unauthorized data access, data modification, deletion, and administrative access.
Mitigation: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.

10.Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Description: Tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated.
Impact: Unauthorized actions performed by authenticated users.
Mitigation: Implement anti-CSRF tokens and validate origin headers.
